Welcome to the homepage of the Notre Dame Clarinet section!

We are proud to be members of the oldest collegiate marching band that is still in existence. Founded in 1846, we even predate our football team! 

We hope that you will take your time and browse around our site. We will try our best to give you a glimpse into the life of the best section in the Band of the Fighting Irish. If you have any comments or questions, feel free to e-mail us at [clarinet@nd.edu](mailto:clarinet@nd.edu). Have fun!
