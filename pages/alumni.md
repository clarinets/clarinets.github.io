Our goal with this page is to compile the stories of our past 'nets. If you are a clarinet alumnus or know where any are hiding, send us an e-mail at [clarinet@nd.edu](mailto:clarinet@nd.edu). We'd love to hear your stories!

We're always very excited to meet alumni as well. If you're on campus, come find us at marchout or Concert on the Steps and introduce yourself!

Thank you for all of your contributions to the 'net tradition!

##Father Sorin

Father Edward Sorin, C.S.C. is the first member of our alumni page. Believe it or not, the founder of our great university was a clarinet player! Hold your 'net high and think that the Notre Dame campus heard the great sound of the clarinet before being defiled by the noise of the lesser instruments. (Faltos, etc.)

##Joseph La Nasa
Class fo 1964

I graduated in 1964 with a B.S. in Pre-Professional studies. I completed my MD degree at LSUMC in NO in 1968. I did an Internship at Charity Hospital in NO 68-69.  After 2 years in Uncle Sam's Army I completed my residency in Urology in 1975. I spent 7 years in Academic medicine at LSUMC -NO and from 1979-82 was Chairman of the Dept. of Urology.

I built River Parishes Hospital in Laplace, La. and left LSUMC-NO to go into full time private practice June 1982. I am still a Clinical Professor of Urology and present lectures in Male Fertility(Andrology) problems to the Junior Med students each 12 week block.

I've been married to Wanda Garcia since 1968 and we have 3 children.  Our youngest, Jonathan graduated from ND in May,1999 with a degree in Finance-Magna cum Laude. He married an ND classmate, Katie Hellend. They now live in Danbury,CT.  Our only grandson, Collin Laird Shannon, who will be one year old on April 13 already is able to recognize the VICTORY MARCH when I play it. He loves to 'Cheer' as I play. 
 
I still remain close to O'B(Robert O'Brien) who is now living in the St. Paul retirement home in South Bend. We talk @once per month.  He would love to hear from other Band Alumni.  His phone # is219-291-3391. 
His address is:
3602 South Ironwood Dr. 
Apt. 336-E 
South Bend, IN 46614 

O'B was band director for 32 years and retired about 12 years ago.  O'B will be 80 years old on June 24, 2001. I hope many band alumni will send him a card or some remembrance on that special day!!!!

##Bill Hausmann
Class of 1973

I still play clarinet, sometimes even for pay, although I have also become corrupted by the evil Saxophone. After 20 years as an Air Force officer, many of those as a navigator and bombardier in B-52's, I now work as a School Services Representative for a local music store. Currently I play clarinet regularly in the Saginaw (MI) Eddy Concert Band (paid summer band), lead alto sax and clarinet in the Baytones (15-piece big band), and "utility infielder" (most recently alto sax, but previously clarinet, bass clarinet, alto clarinet, and tenor sax) in the Bay Concert Band (Bay City, MI community band), as well as occasional pit orchestra gigs on various woodwinds (most recently clarinet, tenor sax, and OBOE (!) for "Anything Goes" and tenor and bari sax for "Footloose" performed by local high school groups). My daughter Kathy (ND '97) was not in the band, but did sing in the Liturgical Choir.

##Rosalind Gaffney
Class of 1985

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/bios/nets85-rosalind_gaffney.jpg">

I graduated in 1985. My daughter Genette is now in the band playing the clarinet ( in 2009-). I have attached a section picture from I believe either 1982 or 1983 season (yes, the Faust years.) Since graduation, I moved back to NY, have worked a variety of jobs in accounting (my major). Married (Edward) have 3 children (Eddie, Genette and Douglas) and 3 grandchildren (Lexia, Jaion and Dehlia). Life is busy. Currently, I work for a staffing company on Long Island, New York. Go Irish and Go Yankees.

##Jennifer Lang
Class of 1994

I'm a 94 grad, and was a part of the Clarinet section for my four years at ND. I was also a member of concert band for three years (though on bass clarinet). I currently work for BMC Software in Houston, TX and live in Katy, TX with my fianc√© Ben (who is a graduate of the University of Texas) and our three cats (no big surprise, they are all named after Disney characters).

##Laura C. Gilligan (Wolkerstorfer)
Class of 1995

I was a member of the marching and varsity bands all 4 years. Since graduating, I have been living in Chicago and working for IBM. I got married on July 30th, 1999, to Jonathan Gilligan. Jon didn't go to ND, but he has been a fan all his life, thus meeting that requirement.  Unfortunately, I don't play the clarinet much any more - only about every 4 years at the reunion!

##Colleen Halloran (Hagen)
Class of 1996 

I just wanted to say hello to all of my fellow 'nets. My name is Colleen Halloran (Hagen) SMC 96' and my e-mail address tells it all! In May 1997 I married a fellow band member, Brian Halloran (ND Drumline)...some of you might know his trumpet brother, Brendan, a senior this year. I just wanted to check in and leave my e-mail address. In light of what happened over the last few days, I was actually checking the band sites for e-mail addresses of band family that I know live in the NY area...I'm just praying none of our band family was affected. Have a great season, nets. My husband, daughter Kathleen and I are going to try and make it up to campus for the Tennessee game and the Navy game. Take care- (Sep. 12, 2001)

Later added:
I've been coaching figure skating professionally and working with Olympic coaches since graduation, but it became more of a full-time job after I quit my systems consulting job when Kathleen was born. I'm a student at Northern Illinois University Graduate School working on a Master of Science in Elementary Education and should be in the school system by Fall 2003.

##Mary Jo Hayes
Class of 1997

I am working in the Chicago suburbs as a civil engineer consultant. To make a long story short, I design parking lots and ponds. I recently became engaged to Mark Mullen, 'net class of '95. The ultimate in section incest. We're currently buying a townhome in Elk Grove Village. Haven't picked up my clarinet since last Alumni Band, which I sometimes feel bad about. Can't wait for the next Alumni Reunion!

##Christy Burke (Veldhuizen)
Class of 1999

Since graduating, a lot has happened in my life. As evidenced by the name change, I got married. I know, it was to a 'bone (Andrew Burke '00), but can you blame me? I currently spend my days designing jet engine hardware and web sites. My nights are still taken up by homework as I continue to work towards my Master's in Aerospace Engineering. I still can't imagine life without homework. If anyone makes it down through Dayton or Cincinnati, look me up.

<a name="erin_evans"></a> 

##Erin Evans
Class of 1999

I graduated in '99, but then I came back as a graduate student '00.  I finally graduated for good in 2000, and I ended up in Chicago, working for the man (I mean, Deloitte & Touche) as an auditor. I live right smack downtown by the Hancock building with Heidi Winker, a drummer from the class of 1999.

##Alyssa Hellrung
Class of 2000

After graduating in 2000 with my very marketable degree in English and Gender Studies, I trained for a while as a Circus Instructor for Club Med, but did not end up going to work for them in the end. Instead I hung out at home in Florida for a few months and I am now back at my home-away-from-home, San Francisco, training at the San Francisco School of Circus Arts until the end of May. This summer I will be working as a Circus counselor at Long Lake Camp for the Arts in upstate New York. It's a sweet camp for kids ages 10-16 who are into dance, theater, music, circus, or visual arts. After camp, I will hopefully be attending graduate school in Creative Writing at either Notre Dame or San Francisco State University. So some of you might be seeing me again in the Fall (run away! run away!). I'll let you know when I do. Write to me! I miss everybody!

##Karen Wolkerstorfer
Class of 2000

Since finally graduating from the School of Architecture, Class of 2000, I have made my way to New York City and am currently working as an intern for a firm located in none other than the Chrysler Building. New York is a different world than South Bend, to say the least--I'm having a great time. Let me know if you ever venture out East. Although I must say that until I decide to make money for rent by playing the ND Fight Song in a subway station, my clarinet lies dormant in a closet...
