## Clarinots? I Don’t Think So
Everybody loves a good underdog story. In fact, some might say Notre Dame was founded on an underdog story (See: Rudy. Or Father Sorin.) So what if I told you that a ragtag bunch of woodwind players would come together and have the most successful season in recorded clarinet sports history? Sit back, relax, and enjoy some highlights from the 2015-2016 clarinet sports season.

*September 12, 2015*

On this warm, fall day, Notre Dame was graced with two miracles. Who could forget Deshone Kizer stepping up for the fallen Malik Zaire, hurling a pass that would go down in Notre Dame history as one of the most amazing touchdown connections of all time, leading the Irish past the Cavaliers. But that wasn’t the only miracle that day. Just a few hours before, the clarinet squad faced up against the athletic trombones in a game of section football. A game that promised tough matchups, fierce opposition, and great competition did not disappoint. 28-7. That was the score of the clarinet’s first section football victory of the year, coming from spectacular plays by rookie Josh See and veteran Greg Ramos. It was not a game to forget, as the clarinets pulled off the incredible upset and took down the mighty trombones.

*April 9, 2016*

Red Sox-Yankees. Packers-Bears. Irish-Wolverines. These pairs all have 1 thing in common: they have become some of the most famous rivalries in all of sports. And right up there with them, particularly after the matchups this year, are the Saxophones and Clarinets. If the blood-ties between the teams weren’t enough, then the close friendships between the two sides is enough to make the competition intense and the matchup memorable. The semifinals of the band basketball playoffs did not disappoint. After losing game 1, the clarinets were inspired by pep talks from senior leaders Maggie McInerney and Madi King, as well as the sideline screams of Julio Salazar and Jamie Maher. “You gotta want it!” He would scream. “Pants him!” She would chide in, referring to the star saxophone player. After some choice words from both sides, and more physical contact than anyone expected from two teams made up of band kids, the dust cleared, and miraculously the clarinets had taken home a victory. Bodies piled on each other, the memory of upsetting the saxophones in their own gym would not soon be forgotten. Maybe next year, Sucksophones.

These two highlights are the tip of the iceberg for what the clarinets hope to accomplish in the coming years. Watch out for us, because we’re coming back next year with a vengeance. Go Nets, Go Irish, and Go ask us how we like our meat.

##### Nets Dominate, Win 28-7

By Julio Salazar, ESPNet

NOTRE DAME, IN- The Clarinet Football team (1-1, in green this week) was back in action this weekend. Because of scheduling conflicts, the game against the Trombone Team was played Saturday, September 12. The starting line-up was as follows:
QB: Danny Cohen (SO)
OL/DL: Maggie McInerney (C, S), Nick Heise (F), Hannah Ray (F) (James Bachmayer went on to take over for Nick Heise after arriving) 
WR: Matt Williams (C, S), Greg Ramos (S), Josh See (F)
After a somewhat lethargic start, the Net Football team got rolling. The Offensive Line offered great protection to first-time starter Danny Cohen (9-20, 85 YDS, 47 Rush YDS, 3 Total TDs). Behind a staunch O-Line, Cohen was able to pick apart the Trombone Defense with long drives down the field. Those drives culminated with a touchdown to Greg Ramos and Joshua See. Greg Ramos (1-3, 15 YDS) and James Bachmayer (1-1, 3 YDS, TD) also had snaps under center. The Receiving Corps also had a good outing, as Matt Williams (5 Catches), Greg Ramos (2 Catches, TD), Hannah Ray (1 Catch) and Joshua See (2 Catches, 2 TDs) piled up yards and decimated coverages. After a seven INT debacle against the saxes last week, the Net offense had no turnovers. Defensively, the Nets were just as good. Solid coverage and 5 INTs (Ramos 1, Cohen 2, See 2) led to Trombone QB Ryan Boyle seeming frazzled all game long, and he was not helped by poor center-quarterback exchanges. Between the two, there were three fumbled snaps (all recovered by Boyle), one of which led to a McInerney sack on the 2 Yard line. Boyle was not helped by the Trombone Receivers. Drops and poor route running gave the QB few options. Pressure on the QB was also great, as the Net D totaled 2 sacks (Ramos, McInerney) and had pressure not seen against the saxes. All in all, the Net Football Team came out resilient and ready to play after a rough loss to a bitter rival in the Cohen Bowl. Head Coach Julio Salazar is undefeated when his teams commit no turnovers. Game 3 has not yet been scheduled. 



## Soccer

We had a record-breaking 'net soccer season this year! We have a combined team with the baritones called OOSE United. Talk to captain [Madi King](/members/seniors/#madi_king) for more information.


| Date | Opponent | Results |
| --- | ---| --- |
| Monday, September 14 | Baltos (Bass/Faltos) | W, 2-0 |
| Monday, September 28 | Saxophones | W, 2-1 |
| Monday, October 5 | Drumbones (Drumline/Trombones) | T, 1-1 | 
| Monday, October 12| Trumpiccs | L, 0-1 |



The ClariTones were very pleased with their overall performance during the 2015 soccer season. Finishing with a winning record of 2-1-1, this team made clarinet sports history. Led by senior captains Madi King and Bill Cahill, the team relied on speed, sharp defense, and physicality. After their hot start to go to 2-0-0, they were matched by the DrumBones and then bested by the TrumPiccs, effectively ending their miracle run to the playoffs. But despite the disappointing end to the season, the team is extremely excited with the young talent that sprung up this year, and they look forward to seeing how the team can grow and develop in the offseason. OOSE United will be back stronger than ever next year.
