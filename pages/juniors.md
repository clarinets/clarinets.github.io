##Anthony Derouin
Studying Abroad

**Nicknames:** AJ, AJ (pronounced “age”), Araali

**Clarinet's Name:** Broseidon King of the Brocean

**Hometown:** Willmar, MN

**Year:** 2018

**Major:** Architecture; Education, Schooling, and Society and International Development Minors

**Dorm:** Morrissey Manor

**Hobbies/Interests:** napping on the Bond Hall Library couches with Claire, backpacking, visiting the Grotto, sailing, making Google Docs/Forms, filling out Google Forms (multiple times), getting snapchats from Jamie, having Jamie make me omelets at North, reading, saving the whales, photography, spending Flex Points conservatively, canoeing, going to LaFunsies, serving others and most importantly reminding people that Minnesota is the best state in the Union.

**Favorite Color:** smaragdine

**Favorite Quotes:** “Live it intensely.” - George Abide (it being the Scout Oath and Law, I am Eagle Scout)

“The older I get the less I believe in coincidence.” - Tony LaPatka

“The reason there will be no change is because the people who stand to lose from change have all the power.”  - Machiavelli

"Temper ambition with practicality"  - Jim (my second year studio TA)

**Gameday Cereal Choice:** Lucky Charms.

**Interesting Fact:** I taught in an Ugandan school for two months this past summer.

**When I was in fifth grade, I thought I’d...** be living with my parents until I was 30 (it’s what I thought they wanted) and be an architect… hopefully these two things aren't mutually exclusive...

**North or South?:** I look at it this way: if you want to impress someone you bring them to South. If you want to eat as a family you go to North. That said South is less than a minute from my dorm and North is going to be torn down soon, so I think we know who the real winner is. 

**Future Plans/Dreams:** Be a teacher in the ACE program, find a fulfilling job that combines my love of architecture, education, travel, and service and still pays the bills, design better schools and better cities that foster healthier communities, help Claire steal a couch from the Bond Hall Library, live on every continent, become fluent in a language, be the best father possible to my children, design my dream home, live a life of giving more than I take, die at the age of 106 so I can see the beginning of 2100.
