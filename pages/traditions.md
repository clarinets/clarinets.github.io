The Notre Dame clarinet section is composed of about 50 students whose interests encompass every major area of study and whose backgrounds range from sea to sea. 

### Gameday Events

#### Drummer's Circle
The 'nets always have a strong showing at Midnight Drummer's Circle, supporting our drumline and kicking off gameday. The clarinets are always to the left of the Main Building steps- come say hi and join in on our many dances to the cadences.

#### Gameday Brunch
The clarinets participate in the band's gameday brunch at South Dining Hall, full of section traditions and mischief!

#### Here Come the Irish
Directly after Concert on the Steps, the clarinets gather under the tree to the right of Bond Hall to circle up and play a clarinet version of Here Come the Irish, arranged by our very own [Sam Squeri](/members/juniors/#samantha_squeri) and alumnus Elizabeth Murphy. Afterwards, the 'nets have another fun-filled dance session!

### Social Events

#### 'Net Fall Bash
Each Halloween, the Nets come together to carve pumpkins, eat some tasty food and spend some time with great friends. 

#### 'Net Christmas
The 'net family gathers together for a Christmas dinner each year, planned by the juniors. We cook giant amounts of spaghetti, exchange Secret Santa gifts, and maybe even chat with Santa himself!

#### LaFunsies
Every Thursday night at midnight, the 'nets gather to hang out, tell stories, eat quarter dogs and Candy Wall candy, and procrastinate on homework in the LaFortune Student Center. It started as an impromptu get-together a few years ago, and now LaFunsies has grown into one of the favorite 'net social events!

#### Band Sports
Making you feel mediocre about your athletic ability since 1842, led by our athletic commissioner [Danny Cohen](/members/sophomores/#danny_cohen). We compete with other sections in the band in football, basketball, soccer, and volleyball. Learn more [here](/athletics/).

#### Other Clarinet Events
Throughout the school year, the 'nets spend a lot of time together at nightly 'net dinners after practice, game watches, campus events, and many many other events! Many 'nets are also involved in other bands and band events, like varsity bands and band service. Check out pictures from some of these events in our [gallery](/gallery/). A huge thanks to our social chairs [Karen Chen](/members/sophomores/#karen_chen), [Danny Cohen](/members/sophomores/#danny_cohen), and [Carolyn Ebner](/members/sophomores/#carolyn_ebner) for planning many of the clarinet social events!
